/*
 * Named overlay for Atlas EZO-pH sensor in I2C mode on nRF5340 DK.
 *
 * Use this overlay when the sensor has already been switched to I2C mode:
 *   1. Connect via UART
 *   2. Send "I2C,99\r"  — switch to I2C address 0x63
 *   3. Send "Plock,1\r" — lock protocol to I2C
 *   4. Power-cycle the sensor
 *
 * This file is identical in content to nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp.overlay
 * and is provided as a named alternative for explicit selection.
