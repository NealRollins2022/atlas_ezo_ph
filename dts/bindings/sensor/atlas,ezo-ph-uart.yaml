# UART bus binding for Atlas EZO-pH sensor.
#
# Zephyr selects this file automatically when the DT node's parent bus
# is UART, matched by compatible + on-bus together.
#
# Shared base properties are in atlas,ezo-ph.yaml (no compatible declared
# there — it is a pure mixin to avoid conflicting with this file).
#
# Note: baud rate (current-speed = <9600>) belongs on the parent &uart1
# controller node in the overlay, not here. It is a bus property.
