# UART bus binding for Atlas EZO-pH sensor.
#
# Zephyr selects this file automatically when the DT node's parent bus
# is UART, matched by compatible + on-bus together.
#
# current-speed belongs on the &uart1 controller node in the overlay,
# not here — it is a bus controller property, not a device property.
