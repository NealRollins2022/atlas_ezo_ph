# I2C bus binding for Atlas EZO-pH sensor.
#
# Zephyr selects this file automatically when the DT node's parent bus
# is I2C, matched by compatible + on-bus together.
#
# Shared base properties are in atlas,ezo-ph.yaml (no compatible declared
# there — it is a pure mixin to avoid conflicting with this file).

      I2C address of the EZO-pH sensor.
      Default Atlas EZO-pH I2C address is 0x63 (99 decimal).
      Can be changed via the I2C,<addr> UART command before locking
      with Plock,1 and power-cycling.
