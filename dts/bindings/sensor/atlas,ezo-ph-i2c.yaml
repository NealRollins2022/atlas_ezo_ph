# I2C bus binding for Atlas EZO-pH sensor.
#
# Zephyr selects this file automatically when the DT node's parent bus
# is I2C, matched by compatible + on-bus together.
#
# Shared base properties are in atlas,ezo-ph.yaml (no compatible declared
# there — it is a pure mixin to avoid conflicting with this file).
#
# Note: 'reg' is intentionally NOT declared here. base.yaml already
# declares reg as type 'array' (the standard DT type for bus addresses).
# Redeclaring it as type 'int' causes a binding conflict:
#   "type from included file overwritten ('array' replaced with 'int')"
# The DT compiler enforces reg's presence for all I2C child nodes
# automatically — no explicit declaration is needed in sensor bindings.
