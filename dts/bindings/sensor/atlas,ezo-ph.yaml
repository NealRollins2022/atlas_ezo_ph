# Base binding for Atlas EZO-pH sensor.
#
# This file is a shared mixin — it does NOT declare 'compatible' or 'on-bus'.
# It is included by atlas,ezo-ph-i2c.yaml and atlas,ezo-ph-uart.yaml which
# each declare the compatible string and their respective on-bus value.
# Zephyr selects the correct bus-specific file automatically based on the
# parent bus of the DT node.
#
# Do not reference this file directly in overlays.
